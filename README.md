#### ❔ **About me:**  

I focus on developing products that combine robust security, good optimization, and a user interface that is clear at a glance.

I refactor my code regularly to keep its quality at a high level, including idiomaticity.

For each product, I use tools such as bundlers, linters, and other utilities to ensure cleanliness, readability, and stability while adhering to solid guidelines
