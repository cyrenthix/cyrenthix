#### ❔ **About me:**  

I focus on developing products that combine robust security, good optimization, and a user interface that is clear at a glance.

I refactor my code regularly to keep its quality at a high level, including idiomaticity.

For each product, I use tools such as bundlers, linters, and other utilities to ensure cleanliness, readability, and stability while adhering to solid guidelines

#### 🤍 **My current main project is [Nury](https://discord.gg/qChjf23kGv)**  
Nury mirrors my personal approach to development, shaped by my own ideas and experience.  

> [!NOTE]  
> While there are still elements of Nury whose quality bar is too low, I am working on addressing this as soon as possible.
