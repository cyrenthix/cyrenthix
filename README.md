#### ❔ About me:

I focus on developing products that combine robust protection and optimization.
Clear and accessible interfaces are also among my priorities. 

I also refactor my code regularly to keep its quality at a high level, including optimization and readability. I strive to become even better at development by making my projects ideomatic

For each project, I use tools like liners, bundlers, and others to make sure my code is clean, readable, and follows solid guidelines.

My current main project is [Nurysium](https://dsc.gg/Nurysium).
It reflects my personal approach to development, shaped by my own ideas and development experience.
