#### ❔ About me:

I focus on developing products that combine robust protection and optimization
Clear and accessible interfaces are also among my priorities

I also refactor my code regularly to keep its quality at a high level, including optimization and readability. Strive to become even better at development by making my projects ideomatic, as well as more thoughtful, using strict data typing

For each product, I use tools like bundlers, liners and other tools to make sure my code is clean, readable, and follows solid guidelines

#### My current main project is [Nurysium](https://dsc.gg/Nurysium)
Nurysium mirrors my personal approach to development, shaped by my own ideas and development experience

> [!NOTE]
> While there are still elements of Nurisium whose quality bar is too low, I'm trying to address this as soon as possible
